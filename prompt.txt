The Problem:
        
        Recycling of materials is a key aspect to creating a more sustainable world. One problem that comes
        along with recycling however is when non-recyclable are included in a recycling bin. There are many
        things to consider when your household waste is being placed into a recycling bin. The term aspirational
        recycler has been coined for when people take non-recyclable or soiled (most commonly with food) and
        place them into a recycling bin. This is done in hopes that they are recyclable and wanting to do the
        right thing for the environment, however, when these non-recyclable item are placed into a bin they can
        contaminate all of the recyclables in that bin. In this case the best of intentions results in large amounts
        of recyclable ending up in landfills because they cannot be processed.

Your Assignment:
       
        Develop a program to help assist in the above problem description. This program can take many forms
        and there are no right or wrong ways to approach this problem. You could consider a possible
        “gamification” of the recycling problem, an educational tool, an automated solution to prevent miss use
        or recycling bins, etc.
       
        Things to consider:

                - This project is intentionally left open ended so have fun when programming it and work towards
                an innovative solution

                - Points will be given for “creativity and innovation” these points will be rewarded based on a
                level of effort that is seen in the project.

                - Holding a brainstorming session with your group on just how to tackle this problem can be
                useful in getting your thoughts organized. This session should be held up front to set the course
                of the project and get everyone working towards the final goal.
                
                - The key to a great project is to have fun in creating it, so do some reading and research and
                brainstorm a solution that can help the world!
                
Requirements:

        • You will need to create two app features that the user can select from. These features should all be completely different from
        each other. A feature refers to something the user can do with the app.
        • In comments, write a brief explanation of your app and how it is supposed to work.
        You need to include at least five functions.
        • No more than one of the required functions can be a no-input and no-output function.
        • You are required to use at least three loops (you decide whether to use while loops, do-while loops, or for loops).
        • You are required to use at least one branching structure (either if statements or switch-cases).
        • You are NOT allowed to use global variables.
        • Your main function should be set up such that you give the user the different app feature options, and the user selects which
        one they would like to do.
        • Include a comment with team number and team member names in each file you submit.
        • Include comments, indentation, and whitespace so that your program is neat and understandable to anyone who reads it.
        You will be graded based on whether all the above criteria were met, and also on the creativity and challenge demonstrated in the app.
